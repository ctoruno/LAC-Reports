                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Ecuador in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 115 perception-based questions and 77 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Ecuador was administered to a sample of 1,005 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Ecuador was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Ecuador: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by StatMark Group, based in Florida, U.S.A.. StatMark Group administered the surveys between June and August 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Ecuadorians aged 18 years or older residing across six major provinces throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Ecuador represents an achieved total sample size of 1,005 interviews distributed proportionally across two regions. StatMark Group based the sampling frame on the 2021-2022 projected population figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization. .

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    Regions, provinces, and cantons were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Within cantons, parishes were selected as the primary sampling unit according to quotas set for age, gender, socioeconomic level, and geographical units. Within urban parishes, enumeration areas were randomly selected. In rural parishes, surveyors constructed the first enumeration area around a central neighborhood and selected additional sampling units from the surrounding area, moving in a clockwise direction. Ten interviews were assigned to each enumeration area. Within the sampled segments, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used a Kish grid to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

During data processing, 50% of the interviews conducted in each city were verified by the central office. Any interview with abnormal audio, answer patterns, or duration was backchecked via telephone. After quality control, 59 interviews were rejected from the final sample. Interviews averaged 40 minutes in length and ranged from 19 to 93 minutes.

                                            As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption Perceptions Index,</i> the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Ecuador are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Ecuador's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru was collected in 2016, 2018, and 2022. Data for Ecuador was collected in 2014, 2017, and 2022.
