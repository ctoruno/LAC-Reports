                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Costa Rica in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 115 perception-based questions and 77 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Costa Rica was administered to a sample of 1,005 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Costa Rica was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Costa Rica: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by CID Gallup, based in San José, Costa Rica. CID Gallup administered the surveys between June and July 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Costa Ricans aged 18 years or older residing across   throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Costa Rica represents an achieved total sample size of 1,005 interviews distributed proportionally across  . CID Gallup based the sampling frame on 2022 population figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Costa Rica (INEC), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization..

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    Regions and provinces were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Enumeration areas were randomly selected according to neighbohoods within each city and the number of interviews per enumeration area was determined by the population distribution in each primary sampling unit. Within each enumeration area, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used a Kish grid to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

Additional quality control measures included geo-fencing, telephone back-checks, and checks for abnormal interview length. Interviews averaged 47 minutes in length and ranged from 40 to 88 minutes.

                                            As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption Perceptions Index,</i> the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Costa Rica are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Costa Rica's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Belize, Costa Rica, and Honduras was collected in 2022, 2019, 2017, and 2014. Data for Panama was collected in 2022, 2019, 2017, and 2014. Data for El Salvador and Guatemala was collected in 2022, 2018 and 2016.
