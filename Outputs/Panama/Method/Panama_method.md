                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Panama in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 162 perception-based questions and 86 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Panama was administered to a sample of 2,023 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Panama was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Panama: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by CID Gallup, based in San José, Costa Rica. CID Gallup administered the surveys in December 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Panamanians aged 18 years or older residing across   throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Panama represents an achieved total sample size of 2,023 interviews distributed proportionally across two regions. CID Gallup based the sampling frame on 2022 population figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama (INEC), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    Regions, provinces and <i>comarcas</i>, and districts were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country based on population density and geographic coverage. Within districts, <i>corregimientos</i>, or jurisdictions, were then selected as the primary sampling unit using probability proportionate to size sampling. Individual enumeration areas consisted of neighborhood blocks and were selected via simple random sampling. The number of enumeration areas assigned to each district was determined based on relative population size. Within each enumeration area, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used a Kish grid to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption</i> <i>Perceptions</i> <i>Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in</i> <i>the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Panama are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Panama's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Belize, Costa Rica, and Honduras was collected in 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2022. Data for Panama was collected in 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2022. Data for El Salvador and Guatemala was collected in 2016, 2018, and 2022.
