                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Bolivia in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 115 perception-based questions and 77 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Bolivia was administered to a sample of 1,000 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Bolivia was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Bolivia: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by Capture Consulting, based in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Capture Consulting administered the surveys between June and July 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included 1000 aged 18 years or older residing across 32 cities throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Bolivia represents an achieved total sample size of 1,000 interviews distributed proportionally across all 9 9. Capture Consulting based the sampling frame on the 2020 projected population figures from the National Statistics Institute, acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Regions and cities were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Within cities, neighborhood blocks were selected using probability proportional to size sampling. Each sampling unit was then selected randomly, and between five and ten interviews were assigned to each unit. Within the sampled segments, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used a Kish grid to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

                                    Challenges to data collection included security issues and accessibility in rural areas although ultimately, no sample units were substituted.

During data processing, 300 interviews (approximately 30% of the sample) were backchecked via telephone by the central office. Additional quality control measures included GPS validation of all sampling segment interviews, checks for abnormal answer patterns, and photo verification. After quality control, 50 interviews were rejected from the final sample. Interviews averaged 45 minutes in length and ranged from 27 to 90 minutes.

                                            As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption Perceptions Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation Index (BTI)</i>, and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Bolivia are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Bolivia's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru was collected in 2013, 2016, 2018, and 2022. Data for Ecuador was collected in 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2022..
