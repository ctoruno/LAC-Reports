                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Suriname in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 167 perception-based questions and 122 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Suriname was administered to a sample of 502 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Suriname was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Suriname: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by D3: Designs, Data, Decisions, based in Virginia, USA. D3: Designs, Data, Decisions administered the surveys between May and June 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Surinamese respondents aged 18 years or older residing across 28 cities and towns throughout the country.

                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    The General Population Poll in Suriname represents an achieved total sample size of 502 interviews distributed proportionally across nine districts. D3: Designs, Data, Decisions based the sampling frame on 2012 population figures from the General Statistics Bureau of Suriname, acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by district, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Dutch, can be found in the Appendix of this report.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Districts and cities were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country based on population density and geographic coverage. Within cities and towns, communes were selected as the primary sampling unit using probability proportionate to size sampling. Individual enumeration areas were then selected randomly. Within each enumeration area, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used survey software to randomly select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.  

Due to accessibility issues, the district of Sipaliwini was excluded
from the sampling frame. Within the Brokopondo district, the Brokopondo
Centrum and Brownsweg communes were replaced Klaaskreek and
Marchallkreek due to flooding that made the original areas inaccessible.

                                            The supervisory team directly oversaw at least two interviews per interviewer in the field. During data processing, 80 interviews (approximately 16% of the sample) were selected for audio review by the central office. Additional quality control measures included GPS validation, data checks, and checks for abnormal answer patterns. Interviews averaged 52 minutes in length and ranged from 29 to 104 minutes.

Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption</i> <i>Perceptions</i> <i>Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in</i> <i>the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Suriname are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Suriname's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for The Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Suriname was collected in 2016, 2018, and 2022. Data for Haiti was collected in 2021 and 2022. Data for Jamaica was collected in 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2022.
