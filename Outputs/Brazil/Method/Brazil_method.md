                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Brazil in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 115 perception-based questions and 77 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Brazil was administered to a sample of 1,109 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Brazil was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Brazil: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by About Brazil Market Research, based in Fortaleza, Brazil. About Brazil Market Research administered the surveys between June and August 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Brazilians aged 18 years or older residing across eight states throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Brazil represents an achieved total sample size of 1,109 interviews distributed proportionally across five regions. About Brazil Market Research based the sampling frame on the most recent population figures from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Portuguese, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    Regions and states were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Within municipalities, census sectors were randomly selected, and the number of census sectors assigned to each municipality was proportionate to each municipality’s population. Within each census sector, survey administrators performed a systematic random route based on listed addresses to sample households and used a Kish grid to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

The supervisory team directly oversaw 11% of all interviews in the
field. During data processing, 160 interviews (approximately 14% of the
sample) were selected for audio review by local supervision teams and
194 (approximately 18% of the sample) were selected for audio review by
the central office. All interviews under 30 minutes were reviewed in
full and disqualified if not properly conducted. After quality control,
180 interviews were rejected from the final sample. Interviews averaged
45 minutes in length and ranged from 28 to 101 minutes.

                                            As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption</i> <i>Perceptions</i> <i>Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in</i> <i>the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Brazil are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Brazil's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

Data for Brazil was collected in 2014, 2017, and 2022. Data for Paraguay was collected in 2021.
