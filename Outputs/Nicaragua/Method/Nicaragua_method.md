                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Nicaragua in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 51 perception-based questions and 16 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Nicaragua was administered to a sample of 1,014 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Nicaragua was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Nicaragua: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by CID Gallup, based in San José, Costa Rica. CID Gallup administered the surveys in January 2023, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Nicaraguans aged 18 years or older residing across 17 departments throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Nicaragua represents an achieved total sample size of 1,014 interviews distributed proportionally across two regions. CID Gallup based the sampling frame on the most recent population projections from the Nicaraguan National Institute of Information Development (INIDE), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by department, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    All interviews in Nicaragua were conducted using a CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing) system via random digit dialing (RDD). For landline users, “seed” blocks of telephone numbers were randomly selected from Nicaragua’s national number framework. The number of seed blocks in a particular department was determined based on relative population size and departments were identified by area codes. To reach mobile cell phone users, cell phone numbers were first classified by residential and commercial use and commercial mobile phone numbers were excluded from the sample. Seed blocks were stratified across mobile providers and divided into segments of 100 phone numbers each. Within each segment, phone numbers were selected randomly based on the last two digits. Two attempts were made to reach each respondent before the system removed the phone number and selected a new one.

Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption</i> <i>Perceptions</i> <i>Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in</i> <i>the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Nicaragua are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Nicaragua's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Belize, Costa Rica, and Honduras was collected in 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2022. Data for Panama was collected in 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2022. Data for El Salvador and Guatemala was collected in 2016, 2018, and 2022.
