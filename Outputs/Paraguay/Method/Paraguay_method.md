                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Paraguay in 2021 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 88 perception-based questions and 69 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Paraguay was administered to a sample of 1,000 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Paraguay was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Paraguay: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by Datum Internacional S.A. and BM Business Partners, based in Lima, Peru and Montevideo, Uruguay, respectively. Datum Internacional S.A. and BM Business Partners administered the surveys between April and June 2021, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Paraguayans aged 18 years or older residing across 17 departments and districts throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Paraguay represents an achieved total sample size of 1,000 interviews distributed proportionally across .na.character 17 departments and one capital district. Datum Internacional S.A./BM Business Partners based the sampling frame on the most recent census figures from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Departments and districts were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Within cities and towns, neighborhoods were selected as the primary sampling unit using probability proportional to size sampling. In urban areas, each enumeration area consisted of a randomly selected block. In rural areas, enumeration areas started at a randomly selected street. Within each enumeration area, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and used the Last Birthday method to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.  

Due to a lack of accessibility, three surveys were conducted in the city
of Filadelfia, located in the Boquerón Department, instead of in Fuerte
Olimpo, located in the Alto Paraguay department. Both cities are located
in the Chaco region of Paraguay.

Additional quality control measures included checks for abnormal answer patterns. Interviews averaged 25 minutes in length and ranged from 19 to 80 minutes.

                                            As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption</i> <i>Perceptions</i> <i>Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in</i> <i>the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2021 General Population Poll in Paraguay are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Paraguay's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Argentina was collected in 2016, 2018, and 2022. Data for Brazil was collected in 2014, 2017, and 2022. Data for Paraguay was collected in 2021.
