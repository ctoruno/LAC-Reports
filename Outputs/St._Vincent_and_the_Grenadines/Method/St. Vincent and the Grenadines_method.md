                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 172 perception-based questions and 122 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in St. Vincent and the Grenadines was administered to a sample of 500 respondents.

                                    The GPP in St. Vincent and the Grenadines was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by DMR Insights Ltd., based in St. Lucia. DMR Insights Ltd. administered the surveys between July and August 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage stratified random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included Vincentianss aged 18 years or older residing across all six parishes throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in St. Vincent and the Grenadines represents an achieved total sample size of 500 interviews distributed proportionally across six regions. DMR Insights Ltd. based the sampling frame on 2012 census figures, acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                    Given St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ population size, regions served as the primary sampling unit. Interviewers were assigned a starting point within each primary sampling unit and performed a systemic random route, while paying close attention to target quotas for gender, age, and income. Interviewers used a Kish grid to select respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

During data processing, 150 interviews (30% of the sample) were backchecked via telephone by the central office. After quality control, 14 interviews were rejected from the final sample due to abnormal interview length. Interviews averaged 38 minutes in length and ranged from 36 to 71 minutes.

Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption</i> <i>Perceptions</i> <i>Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation</i> <i>Index (BTI),</i> and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in</i> <i>the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of St. Vincent and the Grenadines's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.
