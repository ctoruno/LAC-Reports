                                    To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

                                    The General Population Poll used to collect data in Peru in 2022 features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes 115 perception-based questions and 77 experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in Peru was administered to a sample of 1,036 respondents.

                                    The GPP in Peru was conducted for the <i>WJP's The Rule of Law in Peru: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022</i> with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by Datum International, S.A., based in San Isidro, Peru. Datum International, S.A. administered the surveys between July and August 2022, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included 1036 aged 18 years or older residing across 15 regions throughout the country.

                                    The General Population Poll in Peru represents an achieved total sample size of 1,036 interviews distributed proportionally across all 5 5. Datum International, S.A. based the sampling frame on the 2022 projected population figures from the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

                                    In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in English and Spanish, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

                                <p class="mb-4">
                                    Zones, regions, and provinces were selected to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. Within urban districts, “census areas” were selected using probability proportional to size sampling. In rural areas, “populated centers” were selected using probability proportional to size sampling. Within each enumeration area, sampling units were then selected randomly , according to socioeconomic level. Within the sampled segments, survey administrators performed a systematic random route to sample households and randomly selected respondents. If the selected respondent declined to be interviewed or otherwise did not meet the characteristics of the target quota, the interviewer moved on to the next household.

                                    Challenges to data collection included security issues and accessibility in rural areas although ultimately, no sample units were substituted.

                                            As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s <i>AmericasBarometer</i>, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's <i>Corruption Perceptions Index</i>, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's <i>Transformation Index (BTI)</i>, and Freedom House's <i>Freedom in the World</i>. While certain trends captured by the 2022 General Population Poll in Peru are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Peru's rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: Data for Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru was collected in 2013, 2016, 2018, and 2022. Data for Ecuador was collected in 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2022..
