To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary citizens concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

The General Population Poll used to collect data in `r params$sf_country` in `r params$sf_year` features several new questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. In total, the General Population Poll questionnaire includes `r params$sf_perception` perception-based questions and `r params$sf_experience` experience-based questions, along with sociodemographic information on all respondents. Additionally, the GPP in `r params$sf_country` was administered to a sample of `r params$sf_ssize` respondents.

## Data Collection

The GPP in `r params$sf_country` was conducted for the WJP's The Rule of Law in `r params$sf_country`: *Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022* with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by `r params$sf_company`, based in `r params$sf_location`. `r params$sf_company` administered the surveys between `r params$sf_dates`, conducting face-to-face interviews using a multi-stage random sampling design. The target population group for this survey included `r tolower(params$sf_nationality)` aged 18 years or older residing across `r params$af_sunit_number` `r params$af_sunit_term` throughout the country.

## Sample Size & Sample Frame

The General Population Poll in `r params$sf_country` represents an achieved total sample size of `r params$sf_ssize` interviews distributed proportionally across all `r params$af_region_number` `r params$af_region_term`. `r params$sf_company` based the sampling frame on the `r params$sf_projPop`, acquiring a proportionally stratified sample by region, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and level of urbanization.

In order to address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the World Justice Project split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument, in `r params$sf_surveyLang`, can be found in the Appendix of this report.

## Sampling

`r params$sf_sampling`

::: columns

## Description of the Sample

**COVERAGE:** Interviews were distributed across regions to create a nationally representative sample. The majority of interviews were conducted in the `r params$sd_region1_name` region (`r params$sd_region1_value`), followed by the `r params$sd_region2_name` region (`r params$sd_region2_value`) and the `r params$sd_region3_name` region (`r params$sd_region3_value`).

**GEOGRAPHY:** `r params$sd_rural_valueTXT` percent (`r params$sd_rural_value`) of respondents reside in rural areas and municipalities, while `r params$sd_urban_value` of respondents reside in metro areas or cities.

**ETHNICITY:** `r params$sf_ethnicity`

**GENDER:** `r params$sd_female_valueTXT` percent (`r params$sd_female_value`) of respondents were female and `r params$sd_male_value` were male.

**EDUCATION:** `r params$sf_education`

## Data Review and Justification

As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll and compare it with the objective rule of law situation in-country. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)'s AmericasBarometer, Latinobarómetro, Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's Transformation Index (BTI), and Freedom House's Freedom in the World. While certain trends captured by the `r params$sf_year` General Population Poll in `r params$sf_country` are comparable to trends in perceptions data measured by other indices, the experiences, and perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of `r params$sf_country`'s rule of law performance as measured by other sources.

## Historical Data

Historical data in this report derives from the *WJP Rule of Law Index®'s General Population Poll* that is typically administered every two to three years using a nationally representative probability sample of `r params$sf_probSample` respondents. These household surveys were administered in the three largest cities of most countries until 2018, when the World Justice Project transitioned to nationally representative coverage as the preferred methodology for polling. The historical polling data used in this year's reports was collected in the following intervals: `r params$sf_historical`.

## Additional Countries

*The Rule of Law in `r params$sf_country`: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2022* includes comparisons to the following `r params$sf_region` countries surveyed by the World Justice Project during the same period: `r params$sf_comparison`. This report is additionally part of a series that presents findings from the following five sub-regions within Latin America and the Caribbean: Andes (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru); Southern Cone (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay); Eastern Caribbean (Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago); Greater Antilles, The Bahamas, Suriname, and Guyana (The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Suriname); and Central America (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama). Together, these 27 countries are a portion of the 140 countries and jurisdictions included in the *WJP Rule of Law Index 2022* report. Detailed information regarding the methodology of the *Rule of Law Index* is available at: [www.worldjusticeproject.org](www.worldjusticeproject.org).
